// Question 1: Is Unique
// You are given a string. Write a function to determine if all of the characters in the string appear only once.

// Your function shouldn't care about capitalization. A is the same as a.

// Input - "heLlo"
// Output - False

// Input - "hey"
// Output - True




//Question 2: Palindrome Permutation: 
// Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
// EXAMPLE
// Input: Tact Coa
// Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)



//Question 3: URLify
// Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
// EXAMPLE
// Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
